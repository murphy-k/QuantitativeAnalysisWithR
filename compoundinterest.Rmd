We are going to calculate the growth of two different indivudual's just varying their rates of return. 

The formula for compound interest:
$A = P(1+\frac{r}{n})^\frac{n}{t}$


* A = future amount of the investment
* P = principal (initial deposit)
* r = rate of return 
* n = number of times compounded per year (if annual returns n = 1)
* t = total number of times compounded

So let's set our variables and examine.
```{r}
compound <- function(P, r, n, t, digit_rnd = 2) {
  A = round(P * (1 + r / n) ^ (n * t), digits = digit_rnd)
  print(paste(P, "compounded at", r, "for", t, "periods will yield", A))
}

compound(P = 10000,
r = 0.02,
n = 1,
t = 20)
```
