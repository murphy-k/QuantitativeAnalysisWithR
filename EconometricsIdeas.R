# Econometrics Ideas

# Will plotting an instruments 1.5x P/S ratio and 0.3x P/S ratio give me an
# idea of where it’s stock should be valued at any given time ?

# Can I systematically take valuation bands (P/S, P/FCF) and say “given 
# where the rest of similar companies are - here is where x stands" ?
